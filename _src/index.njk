<h2>Global Data File âœ…</h2>
<ul>
{% for entry in faunaGlobal %}
  <li>{{entry.name}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>{{faunaGlobal | length}} entries from the .csv located in <code>/_src/_data/</code>, as expected</p>

<hr>

<h2>Local/Directory Data File ðŸš«</h2>
<ul>
{% for entry in faunaLocal %}
  <li>{{entry.name}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>{{faunaLocal | length}} entries from the .csv located in  <code>/_src/</code></p>

<hr>

<p>The custom data file format (.csv) works while in the <code>/_data</code> directory, but not as a local data file, which as I understand, should work?</p>
